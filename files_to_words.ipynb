       "'\\n41. 다음 Incoterms 2020의 사용범위를 설명하는 내용 중 ( )에 들어갈\\n내용으로 잘못된 것은?\\nThe Incoterms rules are not in themselves - and are therefore no\\nsubstitute for – a contract of sale. They can be used as much for the\\ntrading of a bulk cargo of iron ore as for five containers of electronic\\nequipment or ten pallets of airfreighted fresh flowers. The Incoterms rules\\ndo not deal with ( )\\n① the specifications of the goods sold.\\n② the time, place, method or currency of payment of the price.\\n③ who obtains shipping documents and export or import licences.\\n④ most consequences of delay and other breaches in the performance of\\ncontractual obligations.\\n42. 다음 Incoterms 2020 조건에서 “Delivery point”에 대한 설명으로 잘못된 것은?\\n① In FAS, delivery happens where the seller places the goods alongside the ship\\nnominated by the buyer at a sea or river port, and the risk of loss of or\\ndamage to those goods is on the buyer’s shoulders from that port.\\n② In CFR, delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the\\nagreed port of shipment, if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take\\nthe goods to the agreed port of shipment.\\n③ In CPT, delivery happens at the seller’s end when the goods are handed over\\nto the carrier contracted by the buyer.\\n④ In DAP, delivery occurs when the goods are placed at the buyer’s disposal at\\nthe named place or point of destination.\\n- 24 -43. 다음 중 Incoterms 2010과 Incoterms 2020의 차이점에 대한 설명이 잘못된\\n것은?\\n① It is recommended that parties consider different levels of insurance cover from\\nICC(C) to ICC(A) in CIP.\\n② FCA has changed to allow the buyer and seller to agree that the seller will get\\nan on board bill of lading in conjunction with a L/C.\\n③ CPT includes a specific requirement that the seller must comply with any\\nsecurity-related requirements for transport to the destination, which bring cost\\nand risk delay if not fulfilled by the parties.\\n④ Incoterms 2020 allows for own means of transport by the buyer in the CPT\\nrule and by the seller in the D rules.\\n44. 다음 중 무역계약에 대한 설명이 잘못된 것은?\\n① The parties’ contractual freedom is not unlimited. In all legal systems there are\\nmandatory rules that limit the parties’ autonomy in order to prevent the\\nexercise of their contractual freedom from conflicting with other interests at\\nstake.\\n② The parties can not choose the domestic law that is governing their contract.\\n③ The parties can decide which institution (arbitral tribunal or state court) will\\ndeal with possible disputes arising between them.\\n④ The parties can determine the specific contents (clauses) of their contracts and\\nso establish a set of rules appropriate to their needs.\\n- 25 -45. 다음 중 CISG(1980)에서 규정하고 있는 청약에 대한 설명이 잘못된 것은?\\n① An offer must be addressed only to one person if it is sufficiently definite and\\nindicates the intention of the offeror to bound by such proposal in case of\\nacceptance.\\n② An offer, even if it is irrevocable, is terminated when a rejection reaches the\\nofferor.\\n③ An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree.\\n④ Until a contract is concluded, an offer may be revoked if the revocation\\nreached the offeree before he has dispatched an acceptance.\\n46. 다음은 CISG(1980)에서 규정한 내용이다. 그 내용이 올바르게 연결된 것은?\\n① Offer - An offer should be sufficiently definite and indicate the intention of the\\nofferor to be bound in case of acceptance.\\n② Counter Offer - A proposal other than one addressed to one or more specific\\npersons is to be considered merely as a counter offer.\\n③ Invitation to Offer - A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance\\nbut contains additions, limitations or other modifications constitutes an invitation\\nto offer.\\n④ Acceptance - A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree is not an\\nacceptance even though it indicates assent to an offer.\\n- 26 -47. 다음 중 무역 관련 서류에 대한 설명으로 올바른 것은?\\n① A promissory note is a conditional promise to pay a certain money.\\n② In trade finance, the drawer is the importer seeking to collect money and the\\ndrawee is the exporter.\\n③ Financial documents mean invoices, transport documents, documents of title or\\nother similar documents.\\n④ A bill of exchange is not drawn in the context of a contract where the\\nseller requires the payment in advance.\\n48. 다음 Exclusive Distributor Agreement에서 Distributor의 의무로 적합하지\\n않은 것은?\\n① The obligation not to manufacture or distribute goods which compete with the\\ncontract goods.\\n② The obligation to obtain the contract goods for resale only from the other party.\\n③ The obligation to refrain from seeking customers, from establishing any branch\\nand from maintaining any distributing depot outside the contact territory.\\n④ The obligation to be responsible for the actions to perform the task on the\\nprincipal\\'s behalf.\\n- 27 -49. 다음 내용의 ( )에 들어갈 계약서의 조항으로 올바른 것은?\\nThis Agreement (including the documents referred to herein) constitutes the\\n( ) among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,\\nagreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to\\nthe extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.\\n① Entire Agreement ② Non-waiver\\n③ Assignment ④ Liquidated Damages\\n50. 다음은 국제 계약서의 일부다. 조항의 명칭과 그 내용이 잘못된 것은?\\nArticle 3.
